# Mall Customers K-Means Clustering Analysis

This project performs customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the popular Mall Customers dataset. The goal is to group customers based on their annual income and spending score to help understand customer behavior and target marketing strategies.

## Features

- Loads and explores the Mall Customers dataset
- Visualizes data with pairplots and scatter plots
- Applies the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K)
- Performs K-Means clustering and assigns cluster labels
- Visualizes clusters with color-coding
- Evaluates clustering using the Silhouette Score

## Dataset

The dataset used is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`
